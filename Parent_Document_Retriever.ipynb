They were the last\\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as shespent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on theneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in theiropinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn'tthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because hersister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it waspossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boywas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't wantDudley mixing with a child like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over thecountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie forwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screamingDudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='2because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He gotinto his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\\ndidn\\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of PrivetDrive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinkingof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked andstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around thecorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was nowreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought ofnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help\\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed infunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed thiswas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steeringwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quiteclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley wasenraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man\\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably somesilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrateon drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swoop ing past in broaddaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazedopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had neverseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectlynormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legsand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='3He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\nthem next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'tknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whisperingexcitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was onhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that hecaught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought betterof it.\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almostfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put thereceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he wasbeing stupid. Potter wasn\\'t such an unusual name. He was sure there werelots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\\nof it, he wasn\\'t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\'d never even\\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no pointin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of hersister. He didn\\'t blame her -- if he\\'d had a sister like that... but allthe same, those people in cloaks...\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\\nwhen he left the building at five o\\'clock, he was still so worried that\\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\\n\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing aviolet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir,for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone atlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,happy day!\"\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever thatwas. He was rattled.

It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\n\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a\\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Tryingto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was stilldetermined not to mention anything to his wife.\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley hadlearned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. WhenDudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time tocatch the last report on the evening news:\\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normallyhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have beenhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction sincesunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenlychanged their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going\\nto be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today.

Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s\\nnot until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\nno good.

He cleared his throatnervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sisterlately, have you?\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='5As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry.

It was sitting asstill as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner ofPrivet Drive. It didn\\'t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on thenext street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearlymidnight before the cat moved at all.\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you\\'d have thought he\\'d just popped out of theground. The cat\\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which\\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,\\na purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moonspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had beenbroken at least twice. This man\\'s name was Albus Dumbledore.\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem torealize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. Forsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled andmuttered, \"I should have known.\"\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, andclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. Heclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve timeshe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole streetwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\\nwatching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn\\'t be able to see anything that was happeningdown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside hiscloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='7on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\'t look at it, but after a moment he\\nspoke to it.\\n\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, waswearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tightbun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\n\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\n\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n\"All day?

I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\\n\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggleshave noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her\\nhead back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks\\nof owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. Theywere bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll betthat was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\\n\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.\"\\n\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no\\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out onthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,swapping rumors.\"\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping\\nhe was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"Afine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to havedisappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all.

All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years Ihave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who wasunsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets soconfusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason\\nto be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\\n\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different.

I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls\\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.

It was a very odd watch.\\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were movingaround the edge.

The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brassnumber four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their livingroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night whenMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only thephotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a largeblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing acomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that madethe first noise of the day.\\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto hisback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='14good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny\\nfeeling he\\'d had the same dream before.\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"\\nHarry groaned.\\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.\\n\"Nothing, nothing...\"Dudley\\'s birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,\\nafter pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used tospiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, andthat was where he slept.\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as\\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the\\nsecond television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted aracing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hatedexercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'sfavorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t often catch him. Harrydidn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age.

He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petuniacame back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg.

It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car\\nand crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn\\'t look inthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.\\n\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\nglass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.\\n\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\nwouldn\\'t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- nocompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass tryingto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as abedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\\nto wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\'s.\\nIt winked.\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n\"I get that all the time.\\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the\\nsnake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='21The snake nodded vigorously.\\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\\npeered at it.\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\"Was it nice there?\"The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to\\nBrazil?\"\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\\nthem jump.\\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU\\nWON\\'T BELIEVEWHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened\\nso fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley wereleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back withhowls of horror.\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank\\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed andstarted running for the exits.\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='22The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could onlygibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything exceptsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they wereall back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it hadnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you,Harry?\"\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed tosay, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a\\nchair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He\\ndidn\\'t know what time it was and he couldn\\'t be sure the Dursleys wereasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\'t risk sneaking to the kitchenfor some food.\\nHe\\'d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he\\'d been a baby and his parentshad died in that car crash. He couldn\\'t remember being in the car whenhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during longhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blindingflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\'t imagine where all the green\\nlight came from. He couldn\\'t remember his parents at all. His aunt anduncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to askquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangersthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him oncewhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harryfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of theshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day andthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all thesepeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='23closer look.\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang hated\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, andnobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang.\\nCHAPTER THREE\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONEThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\\nlongest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first timeout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed PrivetDrive on her crutches.\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\'s gang,\\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest andstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quitehappy to join in Dudley\\'s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\'t bewith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\\'s old privateschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on theother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudleythought this was very funny.\\n\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, beforeDudley could work out what he\\'d said.\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\\'s. Mrs. Figg wasn \\'t as bad asusual. It turned out she\\'d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='24and she didn\\'t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch\\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as thoughshe\\'d had it for several years.\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\'tlooking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burstinto tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he\\nlooked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He\\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not tolaugh.\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like\\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\\n\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old\\nthings gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve\\nfinished.\"\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to lookon his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of oldelephant skin, probably.\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the\\nsmell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper asusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='25on the table.\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\\ndoormat.\\n\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n\"Make Harry get it.\"\\n\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\"Make Dudley get it.\"\\n\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who wasvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like abill, and -- a letter for Harry.\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Whowould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn\\'t belong to thelibrary, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yethere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\nMr. H. Potter\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs4 Privet Drive\\nLittle Whinging\\nSurreyThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snakesurrounding a large letter H.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='26\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you\\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed\\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began toopen the yellow envelope.\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\\nthe postcard.\\n\"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\"\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out ofhis hand by Uncle Vernon.\\n\"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n\"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open\\nwith one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green fasterthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within secondsit was the grayish white of old porridge.\\n\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the firstline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched herthroat and made a choking noise.\\n\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\'t used to being ignored. Hegave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\\nHarry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"\\n\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\ninside its envelope.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='27Harry didn\\'t move.\\nI WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.\\n\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming thekitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious butsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen atthe crack between door and floor.\\n\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t thinkthey\\'re watching the house?\"\\n\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon\\nwildly.\\n\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t\\nwant --\"\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\\'s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\\nkitchen.\\n\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an\\nanswer... Yes, that\\'s best... we won\\'t do anything....\\n\"But --\"\\n\"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we took\\nhim in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\\'d\\nnever done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n\"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\\nthrough the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly.\\n\"I have burned it.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='28\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\"\\n\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into asmile, which looked quite painful.\\n\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\nthinking... you\\'re really getting a bit big for it... we think it mightbe nice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom.\\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\\n\"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\\nnow.\"\\nThe Dursleys\\' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\'s sister, Marge), onewhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\\nthat wouldn\\'t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip\\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. Hesat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here wasbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, workingtank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\\'s dog; in thecorner was Dudley\\'s first-ever television set, which he\\'d put his footthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large\\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\\nfor a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bentbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. Theywere the only things in the room that looked as though they\\'d never beentouched.\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\'t\\nwant him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\'d have given\\nanything to be up here. Today he\\'d rather be back in his cupboard withthat letter than up here without it.\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in\\nshock. He\\'d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, beensick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through thegreenhouse roof, and he still didn\\'t have his room back. Harry was'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='29thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\'d opened the\\nletter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at eachother darkly.\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with\\nhis Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\'s\\nanother one! \\'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --\\'\"\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to theground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the factthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a\\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, withHarry\\'s letter clutched in his hand.\\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.\\n\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out\\nof his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\'t received his firstletter. Surely that meant they\\'d try again? And this time he\\'d make surethey didn\\'t fail. He had a plan.\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\'clock the next morning. Harry\\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\'t wake the\\nDursleys.

He\\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and makea cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by thetime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\\'s lap.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='30Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\nI want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes.

As they\\ncouldn\\'t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the smallwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front andback doors so no one could go out.

Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through theboarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the\\nhead for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\\ncomputer in his sports bag.\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they\\nwere going.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an\\nordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, andcomplained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road linedwith shops.\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if itcould sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full ofordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\\nbeneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and\\nbroomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys hadcooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had no sense ofhumor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everythingHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\'t helptrusting him.\\n\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron.

The people hurrying by didn\\'t\\nglance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to therecord shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky Cauldron atall. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he andHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steeredhim inside.\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them wassmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the oldbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. Thelow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to knowHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a\\nglass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\\n\"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great\\nhand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle.\\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this\\nbe --?\"\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an\\nhonor.\"\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say.

They climbed in -- Hagrid with some\\ndifficulty -- and were off.\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.

The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known about\\nthis or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often hadthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep?

So it\\'s you, is it?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\\nthickset and looked extremely mean.

A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought\\nwas that this was not someone to cross.\\n\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have\\nfit the whole of the Dursleys\\' house in it. The stone walls were lit\\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was toohigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led tothe upper floors.\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry\\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\\n-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagallshowed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. Theycrowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually havedone, peering about nervously.\\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term\\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great\\nHall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a veryimportant ceremony because, while you are here, your house will besomething like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes withthe rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend freetime in your house common room.\\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has producedoutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, yourtriumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will losehouse points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points isawarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='91you can while you are waiting.\"\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was fastened\\nunder his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried toflatten his hair.\\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\"Please wait quietly.\"\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he\\nwas joking.\"\\nHarry\\'s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\\nschool? But he didn\\'t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he haveto do? He hadn\\'t expected something like this the moment they arrived.\\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\\ntoo. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whisperingvery fast about all the spells she\\'d learned and wondering which oneshe\\'d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\\'d never been morenervous, never, not even when he\\'d had to take a school report home tothe Dursleys saying that he\\'d somehow turned his teacher\\'s wig blue. Hekept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall\\nwould come back and lead him to his doom.\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --\\nseveral people behind him screamed.\\n\"What the --?\"\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancingat the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fatlittle monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give hima second chance --\"\\n\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost -- Isay, what are you all doing here?\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='92A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\nNobody answered.\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be\\nSorted, I suppose?\"\\nA few people nodded mutely.\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you\\nknow.\"\\n\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to\\nstart.\"\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\\nthrough the opposite wall.\\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and\\nfollow me.\"\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked outof the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doorsinto the Great Hall.\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midairover four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At thetop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\\nProfessor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a\\nhalt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in theflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, theghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harrylooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. Heheard\\nHermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read\\nabout it in Hogwarts, A History.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='93It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the\\nGreat Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\\na four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool sheput a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house.\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\\nthat seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall wasnow staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, therewas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim openedwide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\\n\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty,\\nBut don\\'t judge on what you see,I\\'ll eat myself if you can find\\nA smarter hat than me.\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,\\nFor I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\nAnd I can cap them all.There\\'s nothing hidden in your head\\nThe Sorting Hat can\\'t see,\\nSo try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='94You might belong in Hufflepuff,\\nWhere they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\nif you\\'ve a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,\\nWill always find their kind;\\nOr perhaps in SlytherinYou\\'ll make your real friends,\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\nTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid!And don\\'t get in a flap!\\nYou\\'re in safe hands (though I have none)\\nFor I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It\\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll\\nkill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than\\nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on\\nwithout everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\\nHarry didn\\'t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. Ifonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,that would have been the one for him.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='95Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\nparchment.\\n\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to\\nbe sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause--\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar wavingmerrily at her.\\n\"Bones, Susan!\"\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next\\nto Hannah.\\n\"Boot, Terry!\"\"RAVENCLAW!\"\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left explodedwith cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s\\nimagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought theylooked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sicknow. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, butbecause no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content='96Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\\nothers it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" thesandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almosta whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\"Granger, Hermione!\"\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\\nyou\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he just\\nsat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until ProfessorMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been amistake and he\\'d better get back on the train?\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\\nhe fell over on his way to the stool.

Percy the Prefect got up and\\nshook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got\\nPotter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruffhe\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\\nHagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned\\nback. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,\\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\'dgotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\'s silver hairwas the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as theghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young manfrom the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\\nturban.\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\"\\na Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.\"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\'s turn.

How can you be nearly headless?\"\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\'t\\ngoing at all the way he wanted.\\n\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His\\nwhole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was ona hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly\\nHeadless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the housechampionship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long withoutwinning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a lookat him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.Harry wished they wouldn\\'t, because he was trying to concentrate on\\nfinding his way to classes.\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere differenton a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had toremember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\'t open unless you\\nasked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors\\nthat weren\\'t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. Itwas also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemedto move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visiteach other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\nThe ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly\\nHeadless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the rightdirection, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and atrick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He woulddrop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab\\nyour nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on theirvery first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through adoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-boundscorridor on the third floor.

She patrolled thecorridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out ofline, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two secondslater. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better thananyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly\\nas any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest\\nambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and themovements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to thegreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy littlewitch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care ofall the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only\\none taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old\\nindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\\nup next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned onand on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the\\nEvil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of theirfirst class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\'s name hegave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\\nthink she wasn\\'t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them atalking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\\n\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\\nwill learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class\\nwill leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again.

By the end of the lesson,only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; ProfessorMcGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy andgave Hermione a rare smile.\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\'s lessons turned out to be a bit ofa joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone saidwas to ward off a vampire he\\'d met in Romania and was afraid would becoming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, hadbeen given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of\\na troublesome zombie, but they weren\\'t sure they believed this story.\\nFor one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrellhad fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking aboutthe weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hungaround the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffedfull of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind everyone\\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\'thad any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much tolearn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a head start.\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\\nonce.\\n\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\\nporridge.\\n\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\\'ll be able to seeif it\\'s true.\"\\n\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head\\nof Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving them a hugepile of homework the day before.\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about ahundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 108}, page_content='108circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters\\nand packages onto their laps.\\nHedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in theowlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered\\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\\nHarry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidyscrawl:\\nDear Harry,\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have\\na cup of tea with me around three?\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\nHedwig.\\nHagrid\\nHarry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the\\nback of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\\nhim so far.\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\'dbeen wrong. Snape didn\\'t dislike Harry -- he hated him.\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enoughwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and\\nlike Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter.

Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His\\neyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s warmth.They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but\\nthey caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught\\nevery word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping aclass silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-wavinghere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.

I can teach\\nyou how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren\\'t\\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\\nMore silence followed this little speech.

Then he\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\"You -- Potter -- why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\\nhe\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s anotherpoint you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\"\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\\nhim behind their cauldron.\\n\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind\\nwas racing and his spirits were low.

He wasn\\'t the only one, though: the way Seamus\\nFinnigan told it, he\\'d spent most of his childhood zooming around the\\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\'d listenabout the time he\\'d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\'s old broom.Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ronhad already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared theirdormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\'t see what was exciting about a game\\nwith only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron\\nprodding Dean\\'s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make theplayers move.\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d hadgood reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This\\nwas something you couldn\\'t learn by heart out of a book -- not that shehadn\\'t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid withflying tips she\\'d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through\\nthe Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for\\nanything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, buteverybody else was very pleased when Hermione\\'s lecture was interruptedby the arrival of the mail.\\nHarry hadn\\'t had a single letter since Hagrid\\'s note, something that\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course.

Look, you hold ittight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the\\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,\\n\"You\\'ve forgotten something...\"Neville was trying to remember what he\\'d forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of hishand.\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\\nto fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot troublequicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n\"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\\nhim.\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flyinglesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under theirfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawnon the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees\\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasleycomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started tovibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 116}, page_content='116broomstick.

Hermione Granger\\'s had simply rolled over on the ground, andNeville\\'s hadn\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\'s\\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on theground.\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\\noff the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\'d been doing it\\nwrong for years.\\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said\\nMadam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then comestraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three-- two --\"\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\'slips.\\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\\ncork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his\\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,slip sideways off the broom and --\\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\\nin a heap.

He pulled his broomstick upa little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girlsback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked\\nstunned.\\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh,\\nyeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom\\ntightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin.

A few people below were clapping.\\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball\\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\\nthen start to fall.

In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about thepackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, andthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\\nprotection. \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\\n\"Or both,\" said Harry.\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\\nwas about two inches long, they didn\\'t have much chance of guessing whatit was without further clues.\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was nevergoing near the dog again.\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a\\nbossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really\\nwanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their greatdelight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\'s attention\\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screechowls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\\nit right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.

It\\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\\nunder his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d belearning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening withoutnoticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrapthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a longtail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in goldnear the top.\\nAs seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\\ndusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadiumbefore. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so thatthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='133of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They\\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\\nchildren blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus TwoThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\'Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\\narm. Harry landed next to him.\\n\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\\nmeant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rulesthis evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\\nif it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.Three of them are called Chasers.\"\\n\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\n\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops toscore a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of thehoops. Follow me?\"\\n\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"\\nHarry recited. \"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks withsix hoops, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry\\nquickly.\\n\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -I\\'m\\nKeeper for Gryffindor.

Okay, got that. So what arethey for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are\\nthe Bludgers.\"\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\\n\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\\nBludgers.\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\\nHarry\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breakinghis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed aroundtheir heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed topin it to the ground.\\n\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\\nand strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to\\nknock players off their brooms.

And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the\\nBludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I\\nmean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the sizeof a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silverwings.\\n\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important\\nball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and\\ndifficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weavein and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get itbefore the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches theSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\\nnearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing onsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it -- anyquestions?\"\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting\\nit back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s tryyou out with a few of these.\"\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golfballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\nHarry didn\\'t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\'t carry on.\\n\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily\\nas they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if youturn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played forEngland if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 136}, page_content='136Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardlybelieve it when he realized that he\\'d already been at Hogwarts twomonths.

Hislessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\\nmastered the basics.\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\\nwafting through the corridors.

The mountains\\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Everymorning the ground was covered in frost.

If\\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the housechampionship.\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news\\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\'t know\\nwhich was worse -- people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or peopletelling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn\\'t\\nknow how he\\'d have gotten through all his homework without her, whatwith all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She\\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a\\nvery interesting read.\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cupmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\\nplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\\nthem; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees hadbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicerfor it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the three of them\\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured\\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snapecrossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about\\ntheir guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\'t seen\\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them offanyway.\\n\"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"It was Quidditch Through the Ages.

Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\\nRon\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How willyou learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the rightanswers anyway.\\nHarry felt restless.

Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\\nhe could have it.\\n\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\nSnape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.\\nHe knocked again. Nothing.\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try.

Yet the days crept by, and there could\\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for theexams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance acrossa desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away ifit had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their neckswhile they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into theforest.

The idea\\nof Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\'t keep visiting them in\\ndreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\'t have muchtime to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\nquestions about batty old wizards who\\'d invented selfstirring cauldronsand they\\'d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\'t helpcheering with the rest.\\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they\\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have\\nlearned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\\nElfric the Eager.\"\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron\\nsaid this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake andflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling thetentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No\\nmore studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You\\ncould look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out howbadly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\"\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps\\nhurting -- it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"\\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s\\ncoming....\"\\nRon couldn\\'t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/harry_potter.pdf', 'page': 211}, page_content='211Dumbledore\\'s around.

After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next greatadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. Asmuch money and life as you could want! The two things most human beingswould choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\\nthere, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at theceiling.\\n\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s\\ngone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"\\n\"Call him Voldemort, Harry.

He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followersas his enemies.

Then\\nhe said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you cantell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"\\n\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in whichcase I beg you\\'ll forgive me.

You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you areready, you will know.\"\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"\\n\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as yourmother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... tohave been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,\\nwill give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\\nfull of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a personmarked by something so good.\"\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found\\nhis voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know\\nwho sent it to me?\"\\n\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\nyou might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... yourfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\\nwhen he was here.\"\\n\"And there\\'s something else...\"\"Fire away.\"\"Quirrell said Snape --\"\\n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because\\nhe hated my father.

It was one of my more brilliant\\nideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something.

The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\\nand outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves\\nhoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- ifonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much tostand up to our friends.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell andcheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of peoplehugging him.

Everything I had believed about the way life worked \\nwas the very opposite of how it really was. I had lived decades \\nbelieving that things in life just happen to us. But now, I could \\nsee the incredible truth. \\nI could also see that the majority of people did not know \\nthis secret, and so I set out to share it with the world. Against \\nevery imaginable obstacle I created the film The Secret, and it \\nwas released to the world in 2006. Later the same year I wrote \\nthe book The Secret, which enabled me to share more of what \\nI had discovered. \\nWhen The Secret was released, it traveled at lightning \\nspeed and was passed from one person to another across the \\nplanet. Today tens of millions of people in every country in \\nthe world have changed their lives in the most incredible ways \\nwith its knowledge. \\nAs people learned how to change their lives with \\nThe Secret, they shared thousands of amazing stories with \\nme, and I received more insights into why people experience \\nsuch difficulties in their lives.

Just as laws of physics govern \\naviation, electricity, and gravity, there is a law that governs \\nlove.

The force of attraction of the sun holds the \\nplanets in our solar system, keeping them from hurtling into \\nspace. The force of attraction in gravity holds you and every \\nperson, animal, plant, and mineral on earth. The force of \\nattraction can be seen in all of nature from a flower attracting \\nbees or a seed attracting nutrients from the soil, to every \\nliving creature being attracted to its own species. The force \\nof attraction operates through all the animals on the earth, \\nfish in the sea, and birds in the sky, leading them to multiply \\nand form herds, schools, and flocks. The force of attraction \\nholds together the cells of your body, the materials of your \\nhouse, and the furniture you sit on, and it holds your car to \\nthe road and the water in your glass. Every object you use is \\nheld together by the force of attraction. \\nAttraction is the force that draws people to other people. \\nIt draws people to form cities and nations, groups, clubs, and \\nsocieties where they share common interests. It is the force \\nthat pulls one person to science and another to cooking; it \\npulls people to various sports or to different styles of music, \\nto certain animals and pets.
